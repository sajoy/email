---
A very basic e-mail app.

To run this app:
---
  1. clone this repo
  2. if on a mac, run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
  3. if on a pc, save the repo in a place you can run a webserver like apache from
  4. open index.html in your favorite browser

Bugs:
---
* cannot actually send or rcv emails
* emails cannot be opened individually in folder view
